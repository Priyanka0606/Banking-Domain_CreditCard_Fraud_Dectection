# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

The aim of this project is to identify challenges in fraud detection while dealing with real world data, apply algorithms to analyze information from various data sources and create multiple machine learning models to choose best fit as per the need.

According to an article written by Debra E. Ross,"Credit card fraud, act committed by any person who, with intent to defraud, uses a credit card that has been revoked, cancelled, reported lost, or stolen to obtain anything of value.‚Äù

In this project, we processed the data as per the requirement and performed the Exploratory Data Analysis. Built Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Stacking Classifier, Local Outlier Factor and Isolation Forest Models to detect the fraudulant transactions. Evaluated the classification models using the evaluation metrics like confusion matrics, accuracy , precision and recall.
